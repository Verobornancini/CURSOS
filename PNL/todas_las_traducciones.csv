"I already have access to Typeform.

What day can we see the flow of questions?"
Hi
in the presentation you only had date time ... did you change something?
: clap:
"one thing read, in the capture of the scheduler you have a view of a calendar"
Ole Ole
very good guys
: slightly_smiling_face:
Did you get another mail Ivan?
There Gonzalo told us that if we are going to use the mean-1 stack that is in lightsail
Joseph
I do
It is part of the tests
All right
Yes
Ivan did you get an email?
"<@ U01BDB84630> you share the link, I already spoke with Alfredo."
Get on with it.
Hello Vero. Do not worry.
"Hello good day ! Everything is fine, at 11:30 we have a meeting set up with Gonzalo who will guide us through the deployment. Last week he told us all the steps, but today he is going to accompany us to do it"
Please send me the link. Thank you.
And surely we will talk internal things
There you have to correct some of this
We invite you to an official demo
Not the idea
I'll be a listener.
Invite me please.
It is internal bitlogic
Please send me the invitation.
At 14
<@ U01BYMTTXCH> and <@ U01BS8YKHS8> how do they go with the demo?
The internal demo at what time do you have it?
I think it does not work
So today there will be no daily?
"Ok, now I look at it and I also tell DH"
There I am going to modify the slides to cover the status well
When it suits them
What a day?
Let's get together this week to close flowcharts and define the service as of launch
I don't know how the time boys come
Or how we can organize for the MVP launch
Today we have internal demo
"Hi. Good day.

I saw that there was an update in the Daily, will there be today?"
Go ahead
<@ U01B5AZNSB1> help us with this please.

"Voucher. So we leave it for Monday
Anything around here."
I think as Lean
good !
"As you say, just tell me to connect or not."
"Hi, it seems to me that doing it today is not worth it!"
Good day. Will there be daily today?
I was in meeting
I sent you a whats
"<@ U01B5AQPV39> without access to sendgrid, I can't integrate with sending emails"
"We had agreed to that, sorry if I understood otherwise and do not join"
I thought there was no
"Yes, if they are, I join"
ahh I understood that there was no
Do they add to the daily?
"<@ U01B5AQPV39> changed the channel name from ""dailys"" to ""daily"""
Thank you!
"Vero and Lean, what a good progress, well down everything."
ahh good observation
I sure was that
Notice that they have the same pattern of using the sign!
In red I marked things that caught my attention because they do not condition ... I have more confidence in the English bookstore
"with the text in Spanish (green) I get the new columns ... what it gives me is a percentage of negativity, neutrality and positivity of each message and DSP makes a decision and classifies it in one of the 3 ... I saved it in the CLASS column"
Excellent Vero!
With the text in English (light blue) I get the indices that we had already seen
here are the results
"Second: I tried the new library that works with texts in Spanish, so we wouldn't have the need to translate ..."
"First: after a lot of searching, I saw that there are only 6 translation libraries that are the most used and recommended ... most of them are based behind the google translate API ... I came across the problem of that we do too many requests ... but but but .... I managed to turn the thread around and now we can translate, setting a sleep time between each request."
As for the polarity analysis ... let's see what they think
But everyone
We agree that for now we will not select who to send
"No, as all interviews are modified according to whoever responds"
Beautiful
And send it hahaha
Now comes the party choose who you send it to
I have something to tell you ... regarding the polarity analysis
I like very much !! Congratulations !
Visual list
Sprint next?
That would help us a lot
Yes
<@ U01BYMTTXCH>
From there we should populate them in the mongo
"Good ! In the current survey, we have the data that you mark in bold .... the rest of the data was not asked so we do not have them"
"* Employee ID: * we have a number generated when answering the survey
Name /
Last name /
Birthdate /
* Date of entry to the company: * We have the data of seniority
Management /
* Subgcia, sector or area: * We have the data of the work team
Gender /
* Team leader (y / n): * We have the position information
Date from which you lead the team"
A greeting.
"Employee ID / Name / Surname / Date of Birth / Date of entry to the company / Management / Subgcia, sector or area / Gender / Team leader (y / n) / Date from which team leader

This data could be passed on to us by Vero from Bitlogic's HR and who considers DH to be good at the time of surveys.
With them we could cross information and have the data without biases.
If you see one that is not here and is convenient, tell me to ask for it and add it."
"Ivan, if you want, you can share this image ... he won't let me"
<https://us02web.zoom.us/j/2673612760?pwd=YTk4N0JwNFBtZVk4QmVCazE3K0hEZz09>
Thank you
Docker
"Anaconda, Python, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, Docker"
"React js, Express, Node js, Mongo DB, Google sheets, git, aws"
"As well as those that in the future they see necessary.

Thank you"
Yes
Hi. They have already passed it to me but I can't find it. Please share the technologies we use with me.
good morning Lean!
Today I will be with the process of sending surveys
Good day how are you?
Option 3 seems better to me
"A question. Bitlogic will pass us the information of the collaborators such as name, date of entry, if it brings people, area and two more that I do not remember now.

My question is, once we have this information would we have a single record for the entire time that one person answers all the questions?
I mean traceability, knowing that JUAN PEREZ has always responded to us"
<https://github.com/finiteautomata/pysentimiento/>
"Option 3 can be. What's the name of the library, I'm in the AI ​​Cluster and you can see if they can support us from there."
The director is Laura?
"* As options: *
* 1- * we can see the possibility of having an account to be able to hit the api by accessing with tokens surely ... I don't know if that will have a cost ... I guess so ...
* 2- * I can find another way to translate ... I had already tried T * extBlob * but the same thing had happened to me, so I switched to * googletrans *
* 3- * the director of the diploma shared with me a library for analysis of text in Spanish that came out last week, it is super new ... it is developed by some friends of hers in Spain ... so at least we have that another option."
"It turns out that I reached the translation limit from a particular IP ... I don't know if I have to wait to translate again, or I can have the IP temporarily blocked by the google API ..."
Good !!! I know what happens with translations ...
then before that word would be worth using sendgrid
"It will help us a lot, we will have this JL:

12 months of email credit worth ($ 339.95 / month) which gives you access to the Pro 100 Email API & amp; Advanced 50 plans.
A one-time $ 100 “getting-started” Twilio credit.
Office hours & amp; mentoring from Twilio team of experts.
6 months free access to <http: //Loader.io | Loader.io> to stress test web apps & amp; APIs."
the same official whatsapp ends up costing you an interesting amount of money
Seeeeee
for whatsapp is beautiful
It can be a channel for the bot
Yes
and in voice they have a lot
sms ...
TWILIO IS BEAUTIFUL on the chatbot side via whatsapp and others
"I have already signed up, now we have to wait for them to verify that we are in the ISDI program.
But well, as soon as I have the information I will share it with you."
But I do it today.
I register the account today. We will have to write to those of Twilio so that they activate the promo. I do not know how long it may take.
With a godady and bye
Yes
We still have to see how to lift the mongo
Yes
how lucky to have a good mentor on these things: slightly_smiling_face:
THERE WE WILL GIVE YOU A SUBdomain and voila no +
A crack Gonzalo
GOOD THERE
Is up
<http://54.167.4.192/>
<@ U01B5AQPV39> did you generate the twilio account?
Yes
I think the key now is the excheduler
<@ U01B5AQPV39> do you have any of the visual of sending surveys?
leave it for the last
I will be able to do the GTM thing once the system is deployed
Yes
And they give us credits. Important to clarify.
It is quite powerful
Ivan was doing research
<@ U01BDB84630> <https://www.twilio.com/> We are going to use this application instead of <http: //word.io | word.io>
I did not arrive
Tell me if you have it
Sent.
I did not arrive
Check your email and if you don't have it I'll send it to you again.
I passed you the invitation. Wednesday 25 at 12h (Arg)
What time are these meetings ivan?
"The goal is simple. Let them see the product and how we have done it.
If for that date in addition to what we have there is one more advance, it would be the best.
On Tuesday 24 we discussed it and we dedicated that session to thinking about what we are going to say.

<@ U01BDB84630> can we extend the daily 15 min more, so we see daily and ""ISDI product pitch""?"
Reviewing the dates we talk on the 24th and on the 25th we have a product session with ISDI
<https://erudit.ai/connectors>

Hi leandro. Looked at him.
"Ivan, I ask you to create an account at <http: //word.io | word.io> if it can be"
Hahaha
4K
LOL
haha
You will see again in hd
They are already organized with Hernán and Victoria
: wink:
Without flame probe
Nothing happens Vero!
"Good ! I wanted to let you know that I'm going to need to go out for a while around 5:00 p.m., because they just told me that my other pair of glasses is ready ... so I go to the optician to look for them and I return ..."
"Well, I have PC again"
Thanks Vero
Deliverables for Bitlogic -Wellness Surveys
Until afternoon
I leave them
Vegan
Hahaha
It is the reason for making a barbecue
There you wake up intact the next day
Unless you eat something greasy
I have poor iron health
Less to me
"The thing is, the hangover doesn't last a day"
And from now on I don't have many concrete plans
At 100 I will spend until 120 remembering my birthday
And so on
And then at 60 like I did at 40 I mean like at 20
"haha a mix, 25"
Hahaha
"Now it's like 30, which is more dangerous"
"hahaha harmed.
Do not worry.
Party like 20"
50 is not fulfilled every day
It's perfect
Turning 50
"Guys, before the planning, tomorrow is my birthday, so I will be very little present tomorrow and if there is a celebration, it will probably be a little damaged afterwards."
great !
In today's Daily a scrummaster joins us who will help us with the last sprint
Now we have daily?
it's for 1:15 pm
<https://meet.google.com/yii-hjrk-vhp?authuser=1>
it won't let me add you .... because ivan created it .... but this is the link
So we discuss history
Join me on the bot plis
ok Ivan! : wink:
"Hi. Good day. Today I will not be able to be in the daily. Then I catch up.

<@ U01BS8YKHS8> we speak at the time we meet for the bot text.

Good Friday."
ok: wink:
We will not have a meeting with the ISDI either. I tell them of a date when I know something.
Voucher
But we will use the time to close the last sprint well
No
"Ahhh ok, did something happen?"
We will have to suspend the grommino
I remembered what we had talked about
I could not speak
It looks very cute Lean! Congratulations !
Could you speak to Esteban?
great! later if you think we change the colors of the other graphics let me know
That color goes well. I like.
And ... do you think that this color resembles those of teampulse ??? I can't edit just the same color ... but look for a similar one
LOL
I like the employee more ... haha
Employee or collaborator
do I use the word 'employee' in the charts ?? or do you want another word?
Say
question...
IM conecting
from here we enter the analysis and visualization of the data
I am sharing a report of the exploration and cleaning process of the survey database
"ok, I just started with the surveys, because the slack database was working"
So tomorrow in my morning I look at it.
For my sake. <@ U01BS8YKHS8> give me what you have today to give it a spin too.
better tomorrow if they can. So I show you with what progress today
Notify nomas
I'm on the road now.
Yes. Tomorrow we can see it or later today.
"ok, i got on with this josé ... i'm doing the cleaning first ..."
<@ U01B5AQPV39> this is a critical medium considering when they took out the poll. Can you help asap happen?
"It would be very desirable. Do you want us to get together with the dashboard, data and <@ U01BH0Q8MHB> and analyze it with love?"
yes yes .... do you prefer that I go to analyze the bitlogic surveys?
That's fine. But the first thing is that we have the first client (who is also our payer) who wants to be able to start using their data in our dashboard.
"I can get on with that and see what I ask of the answers obtained and what information I can extract ..... but before plotting silly and crazy as one would say, I asked Hernan to guide me with questions, what kind information would be useful to collect"
"yes yes, it is for the data we already have"
It is a repeated request from Veronica
But the issue is to see how we dump the results that we already have in the dashboard that we already have
Okay
"He told me that when he had them, he was going to tell me this week so he passes them to me and I with those guidelines, I can guide myself to work with the data from the surveys"
I also asked him to ask me what questions he wants to answer with the survey data ... so from that I work with the answers to generate graphs that answer those questions
"yes josé .... I already met with him last week ... and I asked him to try to join the groups of indicators that they created with the 60 questions to see if the bitlogic questions align with that, even in part....."
"See one thing, you had to meet with Hernan to see the issue of how to bring the results of the bitlogic survey to the dashboard?"
Great Vero!
Hahaha
They bought me the Natural Language Processing Course: tada:
Good news !!!
Hug.
"Voucher. Do not worry.
Tomorrow we talk and you tell me."
"We have a meeting with Gonzalo Espert, he is going to explain us how to make CD / CI"
Today we will not have daily
How are you?
<@ U01B5AQPV39> good morning
Voucher. They will be present.
This afternoon we need to know if challenging horizons is going to help us build the dashboard indicators based on the bitlogic survey
"When there is a planning ceremony and the afternoon one is, it is almost better not to put more meetings"
Since we meet in the afternoon
I do not think it's necessary
Hello Good morning Ivan
"Hi. Good day.
Today I suppose we have the daily?"
Hahaha
Total tummy pain lasts a day or 2
Clear
"never mind, we don't decline invitations, right <@ U01BYMTTXCH> ??"
Is the sea too far
Hahaha
A gohan for me
Thanks for so much Jose
Hahaha
I don't like sushi here
What a great
Hahaha
<@ U01BDB84630> Do you invite us to eat Sushi ????? : clap :: clap :: clap:
"Thank you. I already wrote, I hope someone will join."
<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ghXs77TOlmFgjsS9RRlHAyd5Fm2vXkKD>
Take care no more
Hello good day ! ok: wink:
Nothing happens!
Go Ivan! Good day!
"Hi. Very good days.
I won't be able to be in the daily today, I'll be on the road.

Thursday would be the meeting with Defying Horizons."
Hahaha
"If you can close this slack for today so I don't notify you, it would be good ... so I can finish trying something ... thank you, and excuse me"
haha it could be ... I promise you I don't have much left
"Vero, you are going to have to consider another way of logging :)"
I've been moving forward there
But I already have something for that in sight
I never command things
No
You need to be unified to be able to choose who you take the survey to
Too many things
: printer:
But have we not seen that already?
I already told you
Now I write to you again
No
Did Esteban give you the info?
So that they are not different systems
And work with permits
Unify the CRUD of users with the dashboard
In the daily
"On the other hand, I want to comment on something that occurred to me"
Already comes out
How good.
: tada:
Successes Ivan!
"In 12 min we have the daily, I tell you"
Hello guys. Needless
How are you Joseph?
<@ U01B5AQPV39> do you need us to be at the meeting?
Good morning guys
Good!
even!
Have a good weekend!
congratulations <@ U01BYMTTXCH>
Thanks Vero!

LOL
We have to define a background image otherwise it hurts my eyes and I get stressed
: +1:
"If you have it, send it to me by mail"
Thank you
Go ahead
"I'm with him in a meeting, I ask him"
Esteban did I pass you the improvements on the Crud ??
<@ U01BDB84630>

We are ahead
"He has more accent than you, at least for me"

Good Morning. I sent to your email something that Jose shared with us, for a first service, it can be useful according to me."
"Talk to two people from two different companies and they use this communication system. They tell me that they used it in their previous positions. Bear in mind that both people work in companies with more than 1,500 employees."

I just got free
Go ahead
Could it be?
Give me 5 and I'll join
Go ahead! There's no drama
"They brought us a meeting. I will not be able to be in the daily.

<@ U01BYMTTXCH> I handed you the Google thing.

An apology."
"Hello everyone.

Good day. Good with the advance."
Goodnnnn
congratulations on the advance !!
huy Lean your time flew by.
So I will continue now
And when I realized the time was 1 in the morning
I was watching some tutorials to see how to leave the github actions working
Yesterday with Pau we were moving forward but we did not get to complete it
Good day
"I share the link of today's session, in case someone wants to join.
It's about ""Business""

<http://bit.ly/ISDIStart2020>"
Me too
I can in the afternoon
Go ahead
I arm them channel
"Guys when we get together with Paula, give us a CD / CI acceleration?"
I created a folder for each public channel and inside are the .JSON files of the conversations
movement*
"Enter dailys, which is where there is more movement"
here I have them!
Let's assume that you are on a channel where you have been invited
Anyway I see don't kill yourself
now generated me a download token and I'm on it ...
"no, first I tried manual to know if the permission that iván gave me yesterday worked"
Or manual?
Did you do it from the bot?
How good
Well
I just exported from slack the complete history of the public channels that we have here ...
Very good Vero!
Yes
yes
There is a free trial version
"so if the administrator can choose that the bot does not join the channel where he wants to share sensitive information about the company, such as formulas and stuff"
"Anyway, it seems to me that it works the same as the bots that we have been seeing ... in order for it to export, it has to be added to the channel ... either public or private"
Paying for companies that we connect or annual X companies?
<https://www.backupery.com/products/backupery-for-slack/>
"This is called Backupery and it allows you to download all the history of slack, either from public or private channels ... it is also paid ... for now I see that to obtain the conversations from private channels or chat in pairs the options are paid. ..."
Good ! This is another App like the one I gave you yesterday from Flatly ...
: hugging_face:
Very good Vero!
Cool

I give them their blog
Ahhh yes
Jobs files ...
The same would have to see how they define the limits

"Have you defined a Product Backlog?
Do you use a project manager?
Do the meetings end in the agreed time?
Does each of the tasks to be undertaken have a defined person in charge, a delivery time and a ""Definition of Done""?
Have you defined, in writing, any work agreements?"
"It is very similar, what I see is that here they are going to put us more in the waist. Which is very good"
Terrific.

"Sounds good to me + about <@ U01BYMTTXCH>
You send it to him and you ask him if he wants us to meet up for more details."
Or will it boot from 0?
Ask him if he has anything armed regarding that
"Hello <@ U01B5AQPV39> regarding what José Martinez is asking.
1- We have a slackbot that connects to Teampulse slack, this bot currently runs on a local server (my computer). The bot uses Flask and the Slack Event API.
2- At this moment I am in the investigation of getting the bot to collect the conversations. for now that functionality is not implemented. At the moment conversations can be pulled manually from slack with the account Administrator user"

I do
It is part of the tests
All right
Yes
Ivan did you get an email?
"<@ U01BDB84630> you share the link, I already spoke with Alfredo."
Get on with it.
Hello Vero. Do not worry.
"Hello good day ! Everything is fine, at 11.30 we have a meeting set up with Gonzalo who will guide us in the deployment. Last week he told us all the steps, but today he is going to accompany us to do it"
Please send me the link. Thank you.
And surely we will talk internal things
There you have to correct some of this
We invite you to an official demo
Not the idea
I'll be a listener.
Invite me please.
It is internal bitlogic
Please send me the invitation.
At our 14
<@ U01BYMTTXCH> and <@ U01BS8YKHS8> how do they go with the demo?
The internal demo at what time do you have it?
I think it does not work
So today there will be no daily?
"Ok, now I look at it and also tell DH"
There I am going to modify the slides to cover the status well
When it suits them
What a day?
Let's get together this week to close flowcharts and define the service as of launch
I don't know how the time boys come
Or how we can organize for the MVP launch
Today we have internal demo
"Hi. Good day.

I saw that there was an update in the Daily, will there be today?"
Go ahead
<@ U01B5AZNSB1> help us with this please.

"Voucher. So we leave it for Monday
Anything around here."
I think as Lean
good !
"As you say, just tell me to connect or not."
"Hi, it seems to me that doing it today is not worth it!"
Good day. Will there be daily today?
I was in meeting
I sent you a whats
<@ U01B5AQPV39> without access to sendgrid I can't integrate with sending mails
"We had agreed to that, sorry if I understood otherwise and do not join"
I thought there was no
"Yes, if they are, I join"
ahh I understood that there was no
Do they add to the daily?
"<@ U01B5AQPV39> changed the channel name from ""dailys"" to ""daily"""
Thank you!
"Vero and Lean, what a good progress, everything down."
ahh good observation
I sure was that
Notice that they have the same pattern of using the sign!
In red I marked things that caught my attention because they do not condition ... I have more confidence in the English bookstore
"with the text in Spanish (green) I get the new columns ... what it gives me is a percentage of negativity, neutrality and positivity of each message and DSP makes a decision and classifies it in one of the 3 ... I saved it in the CLASS column"
Excellent Vero!
With the text in English (light blue) I get the indices that we had already seen
here are the results
"Second: I tried the new library that works with texts in Spanish, so we wouldn't have the need to translate ..."
"First: after a lot of searching, I saw that there are only 6 translation libraries that are the most used and recommended ... most of them are based behind the google translate API ... I came across the problem of We do too many requests ... but but but ... I managed to turn the thread around and now we can translate, setting a sleep time between each request."
As for the polarity analysis ... let's see what they think
But everyone
We agree that for now we will not select who to send
"No, as all interviews are modified according to whoever responds"
Beautiful
And send it hahaha
Now comes the party choose who you send it to
I have something to tell you ... regarding the polarity analysis
I like very much !! Congratulations !
Visual list
Sprint next?
That would help us a lot
Yes
<@ U01BYMTTXCH>
From there we should populate them in the mongo
"Good ! In the current survey, we have the data that you mark in bold ... the rest of the data was not asked so we do not have it"
"* Employee ID: * we have a number generated when answering the survey
Name /
Last name /
Birthdate /
* Date of entry to the company: * We have the data of seniority
Management /
* Subgcia, sector or area: * We have the data of the work team
Gender /
* Team leader (y / n): * We have the position information
Date from which you lead the team"
A greeting.
"Employee ID / Name / Surname / Date of Birth / Date of entry to the company / Management / Subgcia, sector or area / Gender / Team leader (y / n) / Date from which team leader

These data could be passed on to us by Vero from HR from Bitlogic and who DH considers to be good at the time of surveys.
With them we could cross information and have the data without biases.
If they see one that is not here and is convenient, tell me to ask for it and add it."
"Ivan, if you want, you can share this image ... he won't let me"

Docker
"Anaconda, Python, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, Docker"
"React js, Express, Node js, Mongo DB, Google sheets, git, aws"
"As well as those that in the future they see necessary.

Thank you"
Yes
Hi. They have already passed it to me but I can't find it. Please share the technologies we use with me.
good morning Lean!
Today I will be with the process of sending surveys
Good day how are you?
Option 3 seems better to me
"A question. Bitlogic will pass us the information of the collaborators such as name, date of entry, if it brings people, area and two more that I do not remember now.

My question is, once we have this information would we have a single record for the entire time that one person answers all the questions?
I mean traceability, knowing that JUAN PEREZ has always responded to us"
<https://github.com/finiteautomata/pysentimiento/>
"Option 3 can be. What's the name of the library, I'm in the AI ​​Cluster and you can see if they can support us from there."
Seeeeee
for whatsapp is beautiful
and in voice they have a lot
sms ...
TWILIO IS BEAUTIFUL on the chatbot side via whatsapp and others
"I already signed up, now we have to wait for them to verify that we are in the ISDI program.
But well, as soon as I have the information I will share it with you."
But I do it today.
I register the account today. We will have to write to those of Twilio so that they activate the promo. I do not know how long it may take.
With a godady and bye
Yes
We still have to see how to lift the mongo
Yes
how lucky to have a good mentor on these things: slightly_smiling_face:
"THERE WE WILL GIVE YOU A SUBdomain and voila, no +"
A crack Gonzalo
What time are these meetings ivan?
<https://erudit.ai/connectors>
"Ivan, I ask you to create an account at <http: //word.io | word.io> if it can be"
You will see again in hd
Without flame probe
"Good ! I wanted to let you know that I'm going to need to go out for a while around 5:00 p.m., because they just told me that my other pair of glasses is ready ... so I go to the optician to look for them and I go back ..."
Thanks Vero
Until afternoon
I leave them
I have poor iron health
Less to me
"The thing is, the hangover doesn't last a day"
And from now on I don't have many concrete plans
At 100 I will spend until 120 remembering my birthday
And so on
And then at 60 like I did at 40 I mean like at 20
"haha a mix, 25"
Hahaha
"Now it's like 30, which is more dangerous"
"hahaha harmed.
Do not worry.
Party like 20"
50 is not fulfilled every day
It's perfect
Turning 50
"Guys, before the planning, tomorrow is my birthday so I will be very little present tomorrow and if there is a celebration, it will probably be a little damaged afterwards"
great !

Good Morning. I sent something to your email that Jose shared with us, for a first serve, it can be useful according to me."
"Talk to two people from two different companies and they use this communication system. They tell me that in their previous positions they used it. Bear in mind that both people work in companies with more than 1,500 employees."

Come in just!
I just got free
Go ahead
Could it be?
Give me 5 and I'll join
Go ahead! There's no drama
"They brought us a meeting. I will not be able to be in the daily.

<@ U01BYMTTXCH> I handed you the Google thing.

An apology."
"Hello everyone.

Good day. Good with the advance."
Goodnnnn
congratulations on the advance !!
huy Lean your time flew by.
So I will continue now
And when I realized the time it was 1 in the morning
I was watching some tutorials to see how to leave the github actions working
Yesterday with Pau we were moving forward but we did not get to complete it
Good day
"I share the link of today's session, in case someone wants to join.
It's about ""Business""

<http://bit.ly/ISDIStart2020>"
Me too
I can in the afternoon
Go ahead
I arm them channel
"Guys, when we get together with Paula, what about a CD / CI acceleration?"
I created a folder for each public channel and inside are the .JSON files of the conversations
movement*
Enter dailys which is where there is more movement
here I have them!
Let's assume that you are on a channel where you have been invited
Anyway I see don't kill yourself
I now generated a download token and I'm working on it ...
"no, first I tried manual to know if the permission that iván gave me yesterday worked"
Or manual?
Did you do it from the bot?
How good
Well
I just exported from slack the complete history of the public channels that we have here ...
Very good Vero!
Yes
yes
There is a free trial version
"so if the administrator can choose that the bot does not join the channel where he wants to share sensitive information about the company, such as formulas and stuff"
"Anyway, it seems to me that it works the same as the bots that we have been seeing ... in order for it to export, it has to be added to the channel ... either public or private"
Paying for companies that we connect or annually X companies?
<https://www.backupery.com/products/backupery-for-slack/>
"This is called Backupery and it allows you to download all the history of slack, whether from public or private channels ... it is also paid ... for now I see that to get the conversations from private channels or peer chat the options are paid. ..."
Good ! This is another App like the one I gave you yesterday from Flatly ....
: hugging_face:
Very good Vero!
Cool
<https://towardsdatascience.com/how-we-scraped-data-off-a-slack-group-2b5181ba51bb>
"I had found this note a few days ago ... it is not a tutorial, but it does present a list of data ideas that can be extracted from slack with bots. They are not conversations but it can also be useful to extract these parameters, so as to give context to the conversations"
<https://medium.com/the-flatly-blog>
I give them their blog
Ahhh yes
Jobs files ...
The same would have to see how they define the limits
if it is not for hypertensive the thing hahaha
But it is salty yes or

Do the meetings end in the agreed time?
Does each of the tasks to be undertaken have a defined person in charge, a delivery time and a ""Definition of Done""?
Have you defined, in writing, any work agreements?"
"It is very similar, what I see is that here they will put us more in the waist. Which is very good"
Great.

"Great Lean, give it anything I warn you: slightly_smiling_face:"
I am with the typeform API
If you need help let me know
Well Vero!
"I found an option that I have to test if it works first ... as soon as I get it to work, I will let you know"
"Sounds good to me + about <@ U01BYMTTXCH>
You send it to him and ask him if he wants us to meet up for more details."
Or will it boot from 0?
Ask him if he has anything armed regarding that
"Hello <@ U01B5AQPV39> regarding what José Martinez is asking.
1- We have a slackbot that connects to Teampulse slack, this bot currently runs on a local server (my computer). The bot uses Flask and the Slack Event API.
2- At this moment I am in the investigation of getting the bot to collect the conversations. for now that functionality is not implemented. At the moment conversations can be pulled manually from slack with the account Administrator user"

* 2- * I can find another way to translate ... I had already tried T * extBlob * but the same thing had happened to me so I switched to * googletrans *
* 3- * the director of the diploma shared with me a library for analysis of text in Spanish that came out last week, it is super new ... it is developed by some friends of her in Spain ... so at least we have that one another option."
"It turns out that I reached the translation limit from a particular IP ... I don't know if I have to wait to translate again, or I can have the IP temporarily blocked by the google API ..."
Good !!! I know what happens with translations ...
then before that word would be worth using sendgrid
"It will help us a lot, we will have this JL:

Unless you eat something greasy
And ... do you think that this color resembles those of teampulse ??? I can't edit just the same color ... but look for a similar one
LOL
I like the employee more ... haha
Employee or collaborator
Say
I am sharing a report of the exploration and cleaning process of the survey database
: printer:
Did Esteban give you the info?
Unify the CRUD of users with the dashboard
In the daily
"On the other hand, I want to comment on something that occurred to me"
Thank you
Go ahead
Esteban will I pass you the improvements on the Crud?
<@ U01BDB84630>
She is his compi
They go very hand in hand with UX
I like the hierarchical
the same official whatsapp ends up costing you an interesting amount of money
<@ U01B5AQPV39> Do you have any of the visual of sending surveys?
Hahaha
haha
: wink:
Hahaha
There you wake up intact the next day
question...
"ok, I just started with the surveys, because the slack database was working"
But haven't we seen that already?
So that they are not different systems
Already comes out
It can be a channel for the bot
Yes
leave it for the last
I will be able to do the GTM thing once the system is deployed
Yes
And they give us credits. Important to clarify.
It is quite powerful
Ivan was doing a research
<@ U01BDB84630> <https://www.twilio.com/> We are going to use this application instead of <http: //word.io | word.io>
I did not arrive
Nothing happens Vero!
IM conecting
from here we enter the analysis and visualization of the data
So tomorrow in my morning I look at it.
For my sake. <@ U01BS8YKHS8> give me what you have today to give it a spin too.
better tomorrow if they can. So I show you with what progress today
<@ U01B5AQPV39> this is half critical considering when they took out the poll. Can you help asap happen?
Tell me if you have it
Sent.
I did not arrive
Notify nomas
I'm on the road now.
Yes. Tomorrow we can see it or later today.
That's fine. But the first thing is that we have the first client (who is also our payer) who wants to be able to start using their data in our dashboard.
Hi leandro. Looked at him.
Deliverables for Bitlogic -Wellness Surveys
"ok, i got on with this josé ... i'm doing the cleaning first ..."
"It would be very desirable. Do you want us to get together with the dashboard, data and <@ U01BH0Q8MHB> and analyze it with love?"
yes yes .... do you prefer that I go to analyze the bitlogic surveys?
"I can get on with that and see what I ask the answers obtained and what information I can extract ..... but before plotting silly and crazy as one would say, I asked Hernan to guide me with questions, what kind information would be useful to collect"
"yes yes, it is for the data we already have"
It is a repeated request from Veronica
But the issue is to see how we dump the results that we already have in the dashboard that we already have
Okay
"He told me that when he had them, he was going to tell me this week so he passes them to me and I can guide myself to work with the data from the surveys"
I also asked him to ask me what questions he wants to answer with the data from the surveys ... so from that I work with the answers to generate graphics that answer those questions
"yes josé .... I met him last week ... and asked him to try to join the groups of indicators that they created with the 60 questions to see if the bitlogic questions align with that, even in part....."
"See one thing, you had to meet with Hernan to see the issue of how to bring the results of the bitlogic survey to the dashboard?"
Great Vero!
Hahaha
They bought me the Natural Language Processing Course: tada:
Good news !!!
Hug.
"Voucher. Do not worry.
Tomorrow we talk and you tell me."
"We have a meeting with Gonzalo Espert, he is going to explain us how to make CD / CI"
Today we will not have daily
How are you?

Hi. They have already passed it to me but I can't find it. Please share the technologies we use with me.
good morning Lean!
Today I will be with the process of sending surveys
Good day how are you?
Option 3 seems better to me
"A question. Bitlogic will pass us the information of the collaborators such as name, date of entry, if it brings people, area and two more that I do not remember now.

My question is, once we have this information would we have a single record for the entire time that one person answers all the questions?
I mean traceability, knowing that JUAN PEREZ has always responded to us"
<https://github.com/finiteautomata/pysentimiento/>
"Option 3 can be. What's the name of the library, I'm in the AI ​​Cluster and you can see if they can support us from there."
The director is Laura?
"* As options: *
* 1- * we can see the possibility of having an account to be able to hit the api by accessing with tokens surely ... I don't know if that will have a cost ... I guess so ...
* 2- * I can find another way to translate ... I had already tried T * extBlob * but the same thing had happened to me, so I switched to * googletrans *
* 3- * the director of the diploma shared with me a library for analysis of text in Spanish that came out last week, it is super new ... it is developed by some friends of hers in Spain ... so at least we have that another option."
"It turns out that I reached the translation limit from a particular IP ... I don't know if I have to wait to translate again, or I can have the IP temporarily blocked by the google API ..."
Good !!! I know what happens with translations ...
then before that word would be worth using sendgrid
"It will help us a lot, we will have this JL:

12 months of email credit worth ($ 339.95 / month) which gives you access to the Pro 100 Email API & amp; Advanced 50 plans.

"Well, I have PC again"
Thanks Vero
Until afternoon
I leave them
great !
it's for 1:15 pm
So we discuss history
We will not have a meeting with the ISDI either. I tell them of a date when I know something.
No
We will have to suspend the grommino
I could not speak
Could you speak to Esteban?
I like the employee more ... haha
Employee or collaborator
do I use the word 'employee' in the charts ?? or do you want another word?
Say
question...
IM conecting
from here we enter the analysis and visualization of the data
I am sharing a report of the exploration and cleaning process of the survey database
"ok, I just started with the surveys, because the slack database was working"
So tomorrow in my morning I look at it.
For my sake. <@ U01BS8YKHS8> give me what you have today to give it a spin too.
better tomorrow if they can. So I show you with what progress today
Notify nomas
I'm on the road now.
Yes. Tomorrow we can see it or later today.
<@ U01B5AQPV39> this is a critical medium considering when they took out the poll. Can you help asap happen?
That's fine. But the first thing is that we have the first client (who is also our payer) who wants to be able to start using their data in our dashboard.
"I can get on with that and see what I ask of the answers obtained and what information I can extract ..... but before plotting silly and crazy as one would say, I asked Hernan to guide me with questions, what kind information would be useful to collect"
"He told me that when he had them, he was going to tell me this week so he passes them to me and I with those guidelines, I can guide myself to work with the data from the surveys"
I also asked him to ask me what questions he wants to answer with the survey data ... so from that I work with the answers to generate graphs that answer those questions
"yes josé .... I already met with him last week ... and I asked him to try to join the groups of indicators that they created with the 60 questions to see if the bitlogic questions align with that, even in part....."
"I'm with him in a meeting, I ask him"
"He has more accent than you, at least for me"
Very Argentine that girl

Good Morning. I sent to your email something that Jose shared with us, for a first service, it can be useful according to me."
Apologize
Go ahead
Could it be?
Give me 5 and I'll join
Go ahead! There's no drama
"They brought us a meeting. I will not be able to be in the daily.

<@ U01BYMTTXCH> I handed you the Google thing.

An apology."
"Hello everyone.

Good day. Good with the advance."
So I will continue now
And when I realized the time was 1 in the morning
I was watching some tutorials to see how to leave the github actions working
Yesterday with Pau we were moving forward but we did not get to complete it
"I share the link of today's session, in case someone wants to join.
It's about ""Business""

<http://bit.ly/ISDIStart2020>"
Me too
I can in the afternoon
Go ahead
I arm them channel
"Guys when we get together with Paula, give us a CD / CI acceleration?"
I created a folder for each public channel and inside are the .JSON files of the conversations
movement*
"Enter dailys, which is where there is more movement"
here I have them!
Let's assume that you are on a channel where you have been invited
Anyway I see don't kill yourself
now generated me a download token and I'm on it ...
"no, first I tried manual to know if the permission that iván gave me yesterday worked"
Or manual?
Did you do it from the bot?
How good
Well
I just exported from slack the complete history of the public channels that we have here ...
Very good Vero!
Yes
yes
There is a free trial version
"so if the administrator can choose that the bot does not join the channel where he wants to share sensitive information about the company, such as formulas and stuff"
"Anyway, it seems to me that it works the same as the bots that we have been seeing ... in order for it to export, it has to be added to the channel ... either public or private"
Paying for companies that we connect or annual X companies?
<https://www.backupery.com/products/backupery-for-slack/>
"This is called Backupery and it allows you to download all the history of slack, either from public or private channels ... it is also paid ... for now I see that to obtain the conversations from private channels or chat in pairs the options are paid. ..."
Good ! This is another App like the one I gave you yesterday from Flatly ...
: hugging_face:
Very good Vero!
Cool
<https://towardsdatascience.com/how-we-scraped-data-off-a-slack-group-2b5181ba51bb>
"I had found this note a few days ago ... it is not a tutorial, but it does present a list of data ideas that can be extracted from slack with bots. They are not conversations but it can also be useful to extract these parameters, as to give context to the conversations"
<https://medium.com/the-flatly-blog>
I give them their blog
Ahhh yes
Jobs files ...
The same would have to see how they define the limits
if it is not for hypertensive the thing hahaha

"Sounds good to me + about <@ U01BYMTTXCH>
You send it to him and you ask him if he wants us to meet up for more details."
Or will it boot from 0?
Ask him if he has anything armed regarding that
"Hello <@ U01B5AQPV39> regarding what José Martinez is asking.
1- We have a slackbot that connects to Teampulse slack, this bot currently runs on a local server (my computer). The bot uses Flask and the Slack Event API.
2- At this moment I am in the investigation of getting the bot to collect the conversations. for now that functionality is not implemented. At the moment conversations can be pulled manually from slack with the account Administrator user"

What time are these meetings ivan?
"The goal is simple. Let them see the product and how we have done it.
If for that date in addition to what we have there is one more advance, it would be the best.
On Tuesday 24 we discussed it and we dedicated that session to thinking about what we are going to say.

<@ U01BDB84630> can we extend the daily 15 min more, so we see daily and ""ISDI product pitch""?"
Reviewing the dates we talk on the 24th and on the 25th we have a product session with ISDI
Vegan
Hahaha
It is the reason for making a barbecue
There you wake up intact the next day
Unless you eat something greasy
it won't let me add you .... because ivan created it .... but this is the link
ok Ivan! : wink:
It looks very cute Lean! Congratulations !
That color goes well. I like.
And ... do you think that this color resembles those of teampulse ??? I can't edit just the same color ... but look for a similar one
LOL
Voucher. They will be present.
This afternoon we need to know if challenging horizons is going to help us build the dashboard indicators based on the bitlogic survey
"When there is a planning ceremony and the afternoon one is, it is almost better not to put more meetings"
Since we meet in the afternoon
Clear
<@ U01BXC8LK27>
Hi
"Talk to two people from two different companies and they use this communication system. They tell me that they used it in their previous positions. Bear in mind that both people work in companies with more than 1,500 employees."

4K
I have poor iron health
Less to me
"The thing is, the hangover doesn't last a day"
And from now on I don't have many concrete plans
At 100 I will spend until 120 remembering my birthday
And so on
And then at 60 like I did at 40 I mean like at 20
"haha a mix, 25"
But we will use the time to close the last sprint well
Hello Good morning Ivan
"Hi. Good day.
Today I suppose we have the daily?"
Hahaha
Total tummy pain lasts a day or 2
"never mind, we don't decline invitations, right <@ U01BYMTTXCH> ??"
Is the sea too far
Hahaha
What a great
And be able to change logo
So we should have the hiden fields to save the identity of the surveys
Good day
Hahaha
"Now it's like 30, which is more dangerous"
"Ahhh ok, did something happen?"
A gohan for me
Thanks for so much Jose
<@ U01BDB84630> Do you invite us to eat Sushi ????? : clap :: clap :: clap:
"hahaha harmed.
Do not worry.
Party like 20"
50 is not fulfilled every day
It's perfect
Hahaha
I don't like sushi here
<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ghXs77TOlmFgjsS9RRlHAyd5Fm2vXkKD>
Turning 50
"Guys, before the planning, tomorrow is my birthday, so I will be very little present tomorrow and if there is a celebration, it will probably be a little damaged afterwards."
Hahaha
Take care no more
Hello good day ! ok: wink:
"Vero and Lean, what a good progress, well down everything."
Thank you!
"Vero and Lean, what a good progress, well down everything."
ahh good observation
I sure was that
Notice that they have the same pattern of using the sign!
In red I marked things that caught my attention because they do not condition ... I have more confidence in the English bookstore
"with the text in Spanish (green) I get the new columns ... what it gives me is a percentage of negativity, neutrality and positivity of each message and DSP makes a decision and classifies it in one of the 3 ... I saved it in the CLASS column"
Excellent Vero!
With the text in English (light blue) I get the indices that we had already seen
here are the results
"Second: I tried the new library that works with texts in Spanish, so we wouldn't have the need to translate ..."
"First: after a lot of searching, I saw that there are only 6 translation libraries that are the most used and recommended ... most of them are based behind the google translate API ... I came across the problem of that we do too many requests ... but but but .... I managed to turn the thread around and now we can translate, setting a sleep time between each request."
As for the polarity analysis ... let's see what they think
But everyone
We agree that for now we will not select who to send
"No, as all interviews are modified according to whoever responds"
Beautiful
And send it hahaha
Now comes the party choose who you send it to
I have something to tell you ... regarding the polarity analysis
I like very much !! Congratulations !
Visual list
Sprint next?
That would help us a lot
Yes
<@ U01BYMTTXCH>
From there we should populate them in the mongo
"Good ! In the current survey, we have the data that you mark in bold .... the rest of the data was not asked so we do not have them"
"* Employee ID: * we have a number generated when answering the survey
Name /
Last name /
Birthdate /
* Date of entry to the company: * We have the data of seniority
Management /
* Subgcia, sector or area: * We have the data of the work team
Gender /
* Team leader (y / n): * We have the position information
Date from which you lead the team"
A greeting.
"Employee ID / Name / Surname / Date of Birth / Date of entry to the company / Management / Subgcia, sector or area / Gender / Team leader (y / n) / Date from which team leader

This data could be passed on to us by Vero from Bitlogic's HR and who considers DH to be good at the time of surveys.
With them we could cross information and have the data without biases.
If you see one that is not here and is convenient, tell me to ask for it and add it."

Okay
"He told me that when he had them, he was going to tell me this week so he passes them to me and I with those guidelines, I can guide myself to work with the data from the surveys"
I also asked him to ask me what questions he wants to answer with the survey data ... so from that I work with the answers to generate graphs that answer those questions
"yes josé .... I already met with him last week ... and I asked him to try to join the groups of indicators that they created with the 60 questions to see if the bitlogic questions align with that, even in part....."

<@ U01B5AQPV39> good morning
Voucher. They will be present.
This afternoon we need to know if challenging horizons is going to help us build the dashboard indicators based on the bitlogic survey
"When there is a planning ceremony and the afternoon one is, it is almost better not to put more meetings"
Since we meet in the afternoon
I do not think it's necessary
Hello Good morning Ivan
"Hi. Good day.
Today I suppose we have the daily?"
Hahaha
Total tummy pain lasts a day or 2
Clear
"never mind, we don't decline invitations, right <@ U01BYMTTXCH> ??"
Is the sea too far
Hahaha
A gohan for me
Thanks for so much Jose
Hahaha
I don't like sushi here
What a great
Hahaha
<@ U01BDB84630> Do you invite us to eat Sushi ????? : clap :: clap :: clap:
"Thank you. I already wrote, I hope someone will join."
Nothing happens!
So we should have the hiden fields to save the identity of the surveys
Well there we have the bitnami container
You have to see that
Where do you deploy?
very well
This is the github actions Joseeeeeee
"Talk to two people from two different companies and they use this communication system. They tell me that they used it in their previous positions. Bear in mind that both people work in companies with more than 1,500 employees."
<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/unified-communications/jabber/index.html|https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/unified-communications /jabber/index.html>
Apologize
Go ahead
Could it be?
Give me 5 and I'll join
Go ahead! There's no drama
"They brought us a meeting. I will not be able to be in the daily.

<@ U01BYMTTXCH> I handed you the Google thing.

An apology."
"Hello everyone.

Good day. Good with the advance."
Goodnnnn
congratulations on the advance !!
huy Lean your time flew by.
So I will continue now
And when I realized the time was 1 in the morning
I was watching some tutorials to see how to leave the github actions working
Yesterday with Pau we were moving forward but we did not get to complete it
Good day
"I share the link of today's session, in case someone wants to join.
It's about ""Business""

<http://bit.ly/ISDIStart2020>"
Me too
I created a folder for each public channel and inside are the .JSON files of the conversations
movement*
"Enter dailys, which is where there is more movement"
here I have them!
Let's assume that you are on a channel where you have been invited
Anyway I see don't kill yourself
Did you do it from the bot?
How good
Well
Yes
yes
There is a free trial version
"so if the administrator can choose that the bot does not join the channel where he wants to share sensitive information about the company, such as formulas and stuff"
"Anyway, it seems to me that it works the same as the bots that we have been seeing ... in order for it to export, it has to be added to the channel ... either public or private"
Paying for companies that we connect or annual X companies?
<https://www.backupery.com/products/backupery-for-slack/>
"This is called Backupery and it allows you to download all the history of slack, either from public or private channels ... it is also paid ... for now I see that to obtain the conversations from private channels or chat in pairs the options are paid. ..."
Good ! This is another App like the one I gave you yesterday from Flatly ...
: hugging_face:
Very good Vero!
Cool
<https://towardsdatascience.com/how-we-scraped-data-off-a-slack-group-2b5181ba51bb>
"I had found this note a few days ago ... it is not a tutorial, but it does present a list of data ideas that can be extracted from slack with bots. They are not conversations but it can also be useful to extract these parameters, as to give context to the conversations"
<https://medium.com/the-flatly-blog>
I give them their blog
Ahhh yes
Jobs files ...
The same would have to see how they define the limits
if it is not for hypertensive the thing hahaha
But it is salty yes or
Sis is
Below is to access a free trial period ... they extract the info and give it to you in flat formats such as excel
Myer briggs is terrific
Aho return

🥳
yes i agree
Hahahaha
"It gives a lot of content, at times boring, at times very active"
we have to make a pact hahaha
It's very good
"Get some sleep, more dynamic would be better."
"Have you defined a Product Backlog?
Do you use a project manager?
Do the meetings end in the agreed time?
Does each of the tasks to be undertaken have a defined person in charge, a delivery time and a ""Definition of Done""?
Have you defined, in writing, any work agreements?"
"It is very similar, what I see is that here they are going to put us more in the waist. Which is very good"
Terrific.
Okas
"Oka, coming in!"
"Yes - ""Teampulse - NAME"""
Teampulse - Name?
Same format?
It is interesting what they are saying. So if you want to join.

Thank you."
"Great Lean, give it anything I notice: slightly_smiling_face:"
I am with the typeform API
If you need help let me know
Well Vero!
"I found an option that I have to test if it works first ... as soon as I get it to work, I will let you know"
"Sounds good to me + about <@ U01BYMTTXCH>
You send it to him and you ask him if he wants us to meet up for more details."
Or will it boot from 0?
Ask him if he has anything armed regarding that
"Hello <@ U01B5AQPV39> regarding what José Martinez is asking.
1- We have a slackbot that connects to Teampulse slack, this bot currently runs on a local server (my computer). The bot uses Flask and the Slack Event API.
2- At this moment I am in the investigation of getting the bot to collect the conversations. for now that functionality is not implemented. At the moment conversations can be pulled manually from slack with the account Administrator user"
Jose has already asked your questions.

it's for zoom
Good ! we are with José at the ISDI meet
<@ U01BS8YKHS8> I love how those graphs look !!
"How good it looks. Nice job.
They already tell us <@ U01BS8YKHS8> <@ U01BYMTTXCH> how about the all hands today.

A hug."
"As the HR girls had defined another grouping for the questions, we did it so you can see how they have been working on it, and incidentally it helps us to compare how the groups are being created in the two cases"
* 2- The indexes and the questions that comprise them are shown grouped by Bitlogic *
* 1- The factors and sub-factors defined by Defying Horizons are shown *
"Hello everyone ! good afternoon !! I tell you that I have just finished reanalyzing the bitlogic survey ... I give you the last summary graph made for the same survey, with two different data groups ..."
"I share this. They are ""perks"" that ISDI gives us for being in the acceleration process.

If they consider that one or more serve us, tell me and I ask.

A hug."
THANKS
"I upload the presentation of what we talked about today.
<@ U01B5AZNSB1> and I are going to define the deadlines as well as the person (s) who will be in that activity.

Any comment is welcomed.

A greeting."
I have no problem: wink:
May l
10-11 I have a meeting
I can: +1:
It would be a 45 min meeting.
"Good day. Is a meeting good for you on Wednesday the 18th at 10:30? the objective, to tell them which are the deliverables and KPIs that have been defined with ISDI.
It is important that we all know and are aligned with that."
: raised_hands:
It looks great and it would be best to use it again for future surveys.
"Well, we discussed it in the great daily"
Okay
"this last graphic takes more time because it is more handmade, but since I already managed to get the code to generate it, tmb is a matter of replacing names and percentage"
"the general skeleton is useful, but I will have to adjust some things, such as the names of the parameters that I used, since they are other questions ... but it would be something like replacing values ​​in a formula"
Because the dataset is going to be different from Bitlogic
All this that you are doing also has benefit with the surveys that facilitate us challenging horizons?
"thank you ! Yes, tell me"
A little thing
It is precious
Beautiful
and ..... with a little editing in CANVAS .... it was like this
I managed to make this double donut chart:
New fish were born to you
Very good days ! I have news for you
"As I mentioned before, in this case you can choose to use the average or the median ... the average is affected by extreme values ​​and the median is not ... but in this case we do not have values ​​that greatly modify the indices. ... anyway I calculated the two to compare"
Perfect
in these numbers all the information of the surveys is summarized
"Good afternoon ! I was working with the areas, I show you what I got:
1- Group the questions that belonged to a specific area in different sets of data
2- I calculated summary measures (the average and the median) of each question
3- I calculated a general average that summarizes the information of all the questions"
Of these ... I put together a couple for each comment .... there are 6 .... take into account to read them that the subjectivity index goes from 0 to 1 ... and the polarity index goes from -1 (messages negative) to 1 (positive messages) ... that's why it looks detached from the X axis ... I shortened the axis ... from -0.2 onwards because we had no negative comments ... it's so the bottom part of the graph is not so empty
thank you very much <@ U01BH0Q8MHB>!
It's excellent @vero <@ U01BS8YKHS8>!
"It is already taking shape, little by little"
What a good analysis
"p / a: do not believe that I detect by eye the shade of red that is greater than 0.7 hahaha .... apart from this I get a matrix of numbers, which I color with this heat map ... . and then the numbers are not displayed so that the graph is not overloaded"
Excellent Vero !!!
"What is striking is what I marked in red: no work stress, it is correlated with the amount of work ..... so that shows that there are other factors besides work that are stressing employees."
When the correlation index is greater than | 0.7 | the variables are highly correlated and it is recommended to eliminate one of the pair ..... in this case we have three pairs of variables that exceed 0.7 (I marked them in blue) - & gt; There are 3 questions that could be eliminated for example because they do not provide differential information
"Good afternoon, how are you ? look ... this would be the correlation analysis of the survey questions from bitlogic"
<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1vt-9Gp1-iyBi4nOi388QfdRxTyPDzfM2>
"I share the folder of the drive where I am uploading the processed info of the Bitlogic survey, there are graphs, notes and tables"
okas !!!
Repositioning in google
Later we will see that
teampulse.ia
ahhh: slightly_smiling_face:
that's why it's ia
Also this
"Hi good day
I found this in google .. I pass it because I don't know if it could be a hindrance due to our name and domain"
: muscle:
Great VEro !!!
"Summarizing: The correct way to treat time series is the one you see in the first graph. since it treats the date values, as continuous and not discrete values ​​like the other two graphs ..... but I shared all of them so that you can see and compare"
3. Line graphs: I compare both indices for each channel in the same graph ... and I can see that they are closely related ... they follow a fairly similar pattern ... so it can be seen that the subjectivity in the messages implies that I add an emotional charge so they become more negative or positive
It looks better like this
2. Bar graphs: they do not show the data continuously like the previous graph ....
"1. Most recommended time series graph ... on the X axis is the number of days, on the Y axis the index value: For this example it is the polarity index in the DAILY channel"
Good morning everyone ! I am going to show you some graphs of the indexes as a function of time ......
: raised_hands:
Beautiful
Looks great. Today you tell us
Very good Vero!
I'm working on a Jupyter Notebook to try different graphics and data transformations ... Everything is in Python
What are you putting it together with?
Fantastic
Great
Good Morning ! I'm sharing something of the 2 indexes that we are obtaining
"* <https://runahr.com/recursos/covid/covid-19-una-nueva-causa-de-burnout/|COVID-19, a new cause of burnout> *"
"Hello Vero.

What good news, I am glad that this is progressing.
Very good work there.

: +1:: tada:"
Very good Vero!
They are hashed: wink:
So that they go gossiping .... What is the most used channel?
"for now I need to translate the messages because the libraries I found work in English, in this test use TextBlob"
It made me deny the translation hahaha but I'm glad it came out !!
Genius!
Well ahiiiiii vero !!!
I comment! after a first process of pre-processing the slack messages ... we would already have information on two sentiment indices !! POLARITY and SUBJECTIVITY
Good afternoon !!!!

As you know, this week is also about the pre-acceleration process.
The link to access is the following <http://bit.ly/ISDIStart2020>"
"* NOTE *: What I shared is what was discussed today on the ISDI panel. We create an account in TRELLO, where we set up a dashboard and create tasks to define these points of the diagrams. As the deliverable of the first session, we must leave them in writing so that they can later see it and give us a return."
AN EXAMPLE TO FILL IN OUR OWN SCHEMES:
"* Customer Profile *:
* Gains *: The benefits the customer expects and needs, what would delight customers, and the things that can increase the likelihood of adopting a value proposition.

* Pains *: negative experiences, emotions and risks that the client experiences in the process of carrying out the work.

* Customer Jobs *: the functional, social and emotional tasks that customers are trying to perform, the problems they are trying to solve, and the needs they want to satisfy."
"* Value proposition: *
* Gain Creators *: how the product or service generates profit for the customer and how it offers added value to the customer.

* Pain relievers *: a description of how exactly the product or service relieves the customer's pain.

* Products & amp; services *: products and services that generate profit and relieve pain, and that support the creation of value for the customer."

And tomorrow <@ U01B5AZNSB1> and I will speak with a boy from Mexico to find out how he can help us and if we are in the stage of seeking financing.
